About Bot:-

Created on 23/1/2021 it had a very long journey to be where it is now. 
The Predecessor of this bot (Ebot) was declined for verification by discord cause according to discord it gained servers illegally.
And this was created. The initial name (SueBot) was kept because the Ebot team wanted to sue discord legally that the verification process they had 
was wrong cause we never ever added servers illegally. We used top.gg and Social Media for the bot to gain servers.
It took a year to have 100+ commands and aliases with a lot of support from the contributors of the bot. The most time taking were the commands which could be 
customized according to the server.
